The following describes the strategy game \textbf {RENDEZVOUS} we implemented in C++ using OpenGL. The game revolves around two teams located on diagonally opposite sides of a map aiming to destroy each other’s temple. Each team will have two players protecting the team’s temple. Stating the obvious the team first to destroy the enemy temple wins.
