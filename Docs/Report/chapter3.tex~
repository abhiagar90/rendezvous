Each hero has a unique magic power as described:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Stunner: Freezes the enemy player from attacking, moving, etc. for few seconds.
\item Slower: Reduces the attack capability of the enemy player for few seconds.
\item Disabler: Disables the enemy player from using any magical power for few seconds.
\item Burster: Does burst damage in a single shot.
\end{enumerate}

A hero is not allowed to use magic power in succession. It has to wait for some time before it can re-use the magic. \\

When a player uses it’s magic power on an enemy player, the enemy player is said to be cursed.
