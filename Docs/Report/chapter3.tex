\chapter{Map Details}

\section{Schematic Map Representation}
We have internally divided our map area into a grid of 20 by 20. Consider the schematic diagram of our map in Figure 2. We have represented the map details for one team in a table. The other team area has been left blank for it is a copy and paste mirror image of the same around the diagonal.

\section{Graphical Map Representation}
The graphical representation of our map respectively for both Demons and Angels is shown in Figure 3. Notice the visibility for both the teams.

\section{Notification area}
The game is accompanied by an attribute area on both side of the maps, where the users can keep track of the gameâ€™s progress, etc. The schema for such an area is clearly depicted in Figure 4.
