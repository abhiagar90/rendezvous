rendezvous
==========

Why this is named as "rendezvous" ?
<i>We are(currently) not able to enjoy Rendezvous(our college's annual cultural fest) because we are working on 'rendezvous'! ;) :| :D</i>

<b>rendezvous</b> is a 2-D openGL strategy game built in C++.
It supports both singlePlayer & multiplayer mode (max 4 players)

<b>Singleplayer Mode</b><br>
There will be total 4 players - 1 human & the rest three will be AI bots. You can give commands to your bot friend (check "controls" while in game)

<b>Multiplayer Mode</b><br>
One player starts the game by becoming a host & waits for a certain time to allow others to join. The game is then started & no more players are allowed to join.<br>
If a player leaves the game in between, the game is paused for some time to allow the left player to join again with the same state.
Else the game is resumed & then the player is not allowed to join.<br>
